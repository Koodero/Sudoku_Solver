  - With this programm you can give a sudoku to be solved.
  
  - To run you have to run the main.py in your chosen language.

  - This is slow because clearing the terminal and always printing the board row by row takes time. If you want programm to be faster, you can make it so it print the board once after finishing the board and not clearing the terminal.
